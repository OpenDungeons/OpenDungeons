/*! \brief This class is an utility class to transfer data through ODSocketClient.
 * It should also override operators << and >> for each standard types.
 * ODPacket should preserve integrity. That means that if an ODSocketClient
 * sends an ODPacket, the server should receive exactly 1 similar ODPacket (same data,
 * nothing less, nothing more)
 * IMPORTANT : ODPacket can handle different types of data the same way. For that, when we receive
 * data, we have to know its type (when an int is sent, we know an int will be received). The typical
 * use of ODPacket is :
 * Emission : int myInt;
 *            ODPacket packet;
 *            packet << myInt;
 *            send(packet);
 * Reception : ODPacket packet;
 *             receive(packet);
 *             int myInt;
 *             packet >> myInt;
 * As we can see in this example, we have to know the data type within the packet before reading it.
 * But depending on architecture, default datatype can be different between the server and the client.
 * For this reason, the data returned by a function should never be used directly as ODPacket data. Instead,
 * a temporary variable should be used and sent to ODPacket (sized variables such as int32_t, int8_t, ...
 * should be as used as possible for the same reason).
 * For example : You should NOT do :
 * packet << getName();
 * You should do :
 * std::string name = getName();
 * packet << name;
 * This way, if the function signature changes or if the data type is different (int vs long for example) on
 * different platforms, there will be an error when compiling instead of a probable buggy behaviour at runtime.
 * When dealing with class/structure, the best is to use directly the variables themselves, no getter/setter.
 * For exemple, You should NOT do :
 * Emission : packet << creature->getHp();
 * Reception : double hp;
 *             packet >> hp;
 *             creature->setHp(hp);
 * You should do :
 * Emission : packet << creature->mHp;
 * Reception : packet >> creature->mHp;
 * This way, if mHp changes (from float to double for example), it will still work.
