     *
     * The doUpkeep routine is the heart of the Creature AI subsystem.  The other,
     * higher level, functions such as GameMap::doUpkeep() ultimately just call this
     * function to make the creatures act.
     *
     * The function begins in a pre-cognition phase which prepares the creature's
     * brain state for decision making.  This involves generating lists of known
     * about creatures, either through sight, hearing, keeper knowledge, etc, as
     * well as some other bookkeeping stuff.
     *
     * Next the function enters the cognition phase where the creature's current
     * state is examined and a decision is made about what to do.  The state of the
     * creature is in the form of a queue, which is really used more like a stack.
     * At the beginning of the game the 'idle' action is pushed onto each
     * creature's actionQueue, this action is never removed from the tail end of
     * the queue and acts as a "last resort" for when the creature completely runs
     * out of things to do.  Other actions such as 'walkToTile' or 'attackObject'
     * are then pushed onto the front of the queue and will determine the
     * creature's future behavior.  When actions are complete they are popped off
     * the front of the action queue, causing the creature to revert back into the
     * state it was in when the actions was placed onto the queue.  This allows
     * actions to be carried out recursively, i.e. if a creature is trying to dig a
     * tile and it is not nearby it can begin walking toward the tile as a new
     * action, and when it arrives at the tile it will revert to the 'digTile'
     * action.
     *
     * In the future there should also be a post-cognition phase to do any
     * additional checks after it tries to move, etc.
