  THE ZZIP LICENSE

All rights on the project sources are reserved.

use freely under the restrictions of the Lesser GNU General Public License
or the exceptions described in the following sections that offer additional
rules foremost for static linking of the library into other software parts.
 
* LGPL clarifications

The project material has not been cross licensed with the 
Free Software Foundation (FSF) and it will not do at any point.

The FSF has written the original Lesser GNU General Public
License (LGPL) which is the main opensource license used by 
this project. The FSF has no copyright on the sources. 

All rights to the project sources are reserved and the 
copyright holders are entitled to negotiate other licenses
with interested parties. The LGPL is used as the General
Public License that can be used without any special
license agreement with the copyright holders.

The license holders feel that sometimes the LGPL is a bit
too restrictive but nonetheless good to protect the freedom
of this software. Feel free to contact us on any special
permission you need for your opensource project or some
form of commercial software.

In general, special license agreements will only be made if 
they benefit the creation of free software including donations
to projects and non-profit organization promoting free software 
(from which one can generally get a tax reduction offer).

Regarding example programs you will find a notice in the source
header that they are not under LGPL but the ZLIB license to allow 
you to derive your own programs freely from these source code parts.

* additional static linking 

1) Static Linking Exception 

  The LGPL describes ways to combine the project sources with
  other work not under the same license - the programmers do
  generally call it linking and separate it by their link
  time into dynamic linking and static linking. The LGPL
  ensures that the final recipient of a combined work can
  relink a combined work, including a rule in section 6
  to allow shipping of static linked program binaries.

  The rules in section 6 of the LGPL are often inconvenient and
  not useful to promote and protect the opensource character of
  this project. The recepient relinking freedom can be dropped as
  an extension to the LGPL rules, provided the following rules
  apply. Note that these rules only apply to static linking and 
  as an extension to section 6 and do not touch any other part 
  of the LGPL.

2) OSI-approved Opensource Projects

  You may static link with any opensource project material
  which is under an OSI-approved license. (general-opensource).

  You may static link with any project material under a
  license derived from an OSI-approved license by
  removing restrictions including the removal of 
  restrictions under certain explicit conditions
  that can be fulfilled by all possible licensees
  in a way that the license can be possibly OSI-approved
  later on. (opensource-like).

  A project that applies to these rules can even ship
  with modified sources of the project provided that
  the modifications are still under LGPL and these
  exceptions. (merge-back-acceptance).

  This rule is made under the assumption that relinking is
  not required if the combined work can be derived from
  their pristine sources made available to the final
  recipient. (i-am-no-lawyer).

3) Published And Supported Derivative Work

  Any software, including commercial applications, may
  static link with a modified derivate of this project
  when ALL of the following conditions are met which
  are extracted from the Mozilla Public License 1.0, and
  called section 3.2 and 3.3. over there - these will
  require you to redistribute the modified sources. You 
  may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code 
  version that alters or restricts the applicable version 
  of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

  3.2. Availability of Source Code.

   Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute 
   must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of 
   this License either on the same media as an Executable version 
   or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone 
   to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made 
   available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain 
   available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it 
   initially became available, or at least six (6) months after 
   a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been 
   made available to such recipients. You are responsible for 
   ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even 
   if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a 
   third party.

  3.3. Description of Modifications.
   
   You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to 
   contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that 
   Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a 
   prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly 
   or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 
   Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in 
   (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable 
   version or related documentation in which You describe the 
   origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
